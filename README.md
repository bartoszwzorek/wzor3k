it's just my first try of build my portfolio using html, css nad js - something simple but done by myself using knowledge from few courses Ive studied over last few months.

Trying to do something more than just changing few lines of code in dowloded templates without proper understaing of what I'm actualy doing:)

Hit me up if you have any comments regarding this code and its future alternations.

thanks
